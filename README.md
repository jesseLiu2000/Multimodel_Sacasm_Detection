# Multimodel_Sacasm_Detection
Here is my undergraduate thesis (2022.6)</br>
Text - BERT Pre-train model </br>
Image - ResNet50 Pre-train model </br>
I use the public dataset from [Multi-Modal Sarcasm Detection in Twitter with Hierarchical Fusion Model](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1239) (Cai et al., ACL 2019) </br>
I use the attention mechanism and low_rank tensor fusion to build the Fusion Model to finish the feature fusion and then send them to classifier to judge the input </br>
I will continue optimize my model cause it haven't attach the expected result
